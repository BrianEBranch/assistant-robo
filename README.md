# Stanley: A Jarvis-like AI Assistant meant to be used with my Raspberry Pi
Stanley is aimed to be a versatile AI assistant designed to help with daily tasks. Inspired by Jarvis from the Marvel universe, Stanley aims to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for managing your day-to-day activities via a Raspberry Pi. 

# Currently
Due to some issues with travelling and my Macbook backend development has come to a temporary stop until I get back home.
However, front-end development has started, woop woop!

## Features
Currently as I iron out some kinks, Stanley is in the basic functionality phase, but here's what you can expect:
- Voice Commands: Stanley can understand and execute simple voice commands to assist you with various tasks.
- Task Management: Basic task management features, such as reminders and to-do lists.
- Information Retreival: Retrieve information from the web and provide updates on news, weather, and more.
